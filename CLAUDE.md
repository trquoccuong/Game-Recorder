# Odx Game Data Capture

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

Odx is the vendor building game-data capture software for a client.

## Build & test

Toolchain: .NET 10 SDK, CMake ≥ 3.24 + MSVC (C++20); ffmpeg/ffprobe on PATH for the video tests.

```bash
# C# (from capture/dotnet/)
dotnet build && dotnet test

# C++ (from capture/native/extractor/; build capture/dotnet first so ctest can build + validate the synthetic capture)
cmake -B build && cmake --build build --config Debug
ctest --test-dir build -C Debug

# Self-contained package with ffmpeg (from capture/dotnet/; builds ffmpeg in MSYS2 once) -> dist/odx-capture-<ver>-win-x64.zip
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File publish.ps1 -Version 0.1.0
```

## Working rules

1. **Specs in `document/` drive the code** — cite the spec section (e.g. `v2 §1.5`, `plan §7.10`) when implementing or changing behavior.
2. **Don't edit `document/raw/`** — the PDFs are originals; Markdown versions are the working copies.
3. **One implementation per format** — geometry, input aggregation, `frames.csv`, `session.json` and the validator exist only in C# (`Odx.Core` / `Odx.Capture` / `Odx.Merge`). Capture tools, C++ extractor included, write raw logs only; each log format is pinned by a fixture in `capture/dotnet/fixtures/` that the writer must reproduce byte for byte.
4. **Unresolved spec questions go to the README** — list them under "Decisions pending with the client" in `capture/README.md`; don't silently pick an interpretation.
5. **Compliance** — follow `document/games/README.md` ground rules: no anti-cheat bypass, no public matchmaking, no client memory reading on anti-cheat-protected titles.
6. **Code is the source of truth; comment only when necessary** — names and structure carry the "what". Write a comment only for what the code cannot say: why a choice was made, a non-obvious constraint (ABI layout, threading, loader lock), a magic number, a cross-language contract, or a spec reference. No comments that restate the function/class name, no section banners, no commented-out code. Delete a comment that has gone stale instead of leaving it wrong.
